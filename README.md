# Current Project

# Berlin_Mietpreise

With this repo I want to learn about some data engineering technologies and best practices. 
The base for this project will be data that I scraped via the WG Gesucht Webscraper in my Webscraper Repo.

#### The main goal of this project is to anwser some questions related to the living costs in Berlin:

  - What quarters are affoardable? 
  - Are there any patterns in the pricing of apartments?
  - Can I recognize some similarities in the way the apartment gets advertised?
  - Is there a question that could be anwsered by a ML Algorithm?

#### The key topics I want to learn about while doing this project:
  - How to set up and operate a remote SQL Server instance
  - How to write code for ETL processes
  - Joining multiple data sources
  - writing production level python code
  - applying machine learning algorithms and writing special pipelines for them
  - Technologies I want to try out:
      - (tbd)


There will be several steps I want this project to take:

### 1. Set up an ETL process

### 2. Automate all processes

### 3. Build an easy to use Dashboard

### (4. Write a medium article about this project)
